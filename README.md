# WPDX | Water Points in Zambia Data Analysis

Project Scope

This project aims to analyze data related to water points in Zambia. The data regarding the water points was compiled by the Water Point Data Exchange (WPDX). The WPDX is a platform to compile crowdsourced data focused on rural water points (wells, springs, tap stands, etc.) with contributions from governments, NGOs, and researchers.
This analysis focused on factors such as; 

Number of water points in a district

Status (functional & non-functional) of the water points

Type of water source

Technology used to access water

Donors of water access technology

Water points installed in a particular year

Project Approach

The dataset for this analysis was obtained from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) website. The preparation and cleaning of the data in the dataset was done using Microsoft Excel. Thereafter, the dataset was imported into MySQL Workbench for analysis using SQL. Finally, visualizations of the analyzed data were created using Tableau.
